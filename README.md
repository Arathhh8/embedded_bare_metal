# Description

This project is an implementation of how to build a project for an stm32f103 microcontroller by bare-metal process, without using an IDE.

## TOOLS

### Cross-compilation toolchains

* Toolchain or cross-compilation toolchain is a collection of binaries which allows you to compile, assemble and link your applications.

* It also contains binaries to debug the application on the target.

* Toolchain also comes with other binaries which help you to analyze the executables:
  * dissect different sections of the executable.
  * disassemble.
  * extract symbol and size information.
  * convert executable to other formats such as bin, ihex.
  * provides 'C' standard libraries.

#### Popular Tool-chains

1. GNU Tools (GCC) for ARM Embedded Processors (free and open source)
2. armcc from ARM Ltd. (ships with KEIL, code restriction version, requires licensing)
