# Linker Script

The linker script is a file that guides the linker (the tool that combines the object code generated by the compiler into a single executable) on how to organize the memory sections in the final file, which is usually an .elf file. For embedded systems, this is critical as specific hardware memory constraints must be met.

## Memory command

Syntax:

    MEMORY
    {
        name(attr) : ORIGIN = origin, LENGTH = len
    }

    attr letter     Meaning

    R               Read-only sections
    W               Read and write sections
    X               Sections containing executable code
    A               Allocated sections
    I               Initialized sections
    L               Same as 'I'
    !               Invert the sense of any of the following attributes

## Sections command

- Sections commnad is used to create different output sections in the final .elf executable.
- Important command by which you can instruct the linker how to merge the input sections to yield an output section.
- This commnad also controls the order in which different output sections appear in the .elf file generated.
- By using this commnand, you also mention the placement of a section in memory region. For example, you instruct the linker to place the .text section in the FLASH memory region, which is described by the MEMORY command.
